Steve had managed to get Don Knuth, the legendary Stanford professor of computer science, to give a lunchtime lecture to the Mac team. Knuth is the author of at least a dozen books, including the massive and somewhat impenetrable trilogy "The Art of Computer Programming." (For an amusing look at Knuth's heady self image, and his $2.56 reward program, see [link:http//www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/books.html:http//www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/books.html])

  
  
  
  
I was sitting in Steve's office when Lynn Takahashi, Steve's assistant, announced Knuth's arrival. Steve bounced out of his chair, bounded over to the door and extended a welcoming hand.  
  
  
"It's a pleasure to meet you, Professor Knuth," Steve said. "I've read all of your books."  
  
  
"You're full of shit," Knuth responded.
