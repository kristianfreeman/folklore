[Folklore](http://www.folklore.org/) is a collection of stories regarding Apple and the software industry in the late 70s and 80s, written by [Andy Hertzfeld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hertzfeld), member of the original Apple Macintosh team.

This repo serves as both a backup of the original site, and a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site containing some enhancements that I would've liked to see on the original site.

This site uses the awesome [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme for Jekyll. <3 mdo
